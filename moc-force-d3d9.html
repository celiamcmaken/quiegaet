                            <p> Basically, when "-force-d3d9" stopped working the blue lines in the ammnomicon returned. Mostly it's not a problem, however I can not see the cheese on the Infuriating Notes. Is there any other way I can get that information? Is it in any file? I know it's random for every player, is trial and error my only option. Any suggestions. 
Are the graphics much worse while using the -force-d3d9 parameter? Especially I have a GTX 260m on my old laptop (dx10) and forcing dx9 has allowed me to play this game. I've just gotten past the prologue and into the watchtower with no hitches. Yes, there are some graphical glitches like foliage not looking quite right but it's not all foliage but rather certain plants. Around 15-30 fps all low, and at 720p. Still looks and sounds quite good via hdmi to a big screen. Regardless, if you want to experience the story and DO NOT meet the dx11 requirement there is still. Game wouldn't start when I tried it. Thank. 
Right click it in steam, go to properties, select "set launch options", and paste "-force-d3d9" in. Hit OK and launch. It's possible to stream without setting this, but you need to use desktop mode which is not limited to a single application. • Go to C:\Program Files (x86)\Jagex\Chronicle\Game. • Right click Chronicle.exe. • Create Shortcut. • Right click the shortcut, "Properties". • Add this at the end of "Target" box content : " -force-d3d9" • Now execute the game from that shortcut. Step by step screenshots: Worked for me, of course this is supposed to be a temp solution while devs fix it, however you should see some graphical glitches. Edit: There are other implications check the forum I can create my party and enter into the starting area just fine. I'm able to run around, collect everything, recruit Angela Deth and everything. But when I try to leave the starting area for the world map, the load screen comes up, the load progess bar is about 1/8 of the way filled, and then the exe self-terminates. Anyone have any idea how to fix? I've tried reducing texture size and running in windowed mode, but I have a nice rig so I don't think that's the problem. Thanks. SOLVED: adding. Hey , I'm having graphical errors with Rust. After about 10 minutes in game the sky starts flashing white and eventually gets unplayble. I've heard of these problems with people that have AMD cards(which I have, a 7950). I saw on the fourms to put force-d3d9 in the launch options on steam, I did this and it didn't change anything, still getting the same problem. Any help would be much appreciated, Thanks. 
Before the update, I was able to make the game run on kubuntu 18.04 through Wine by adding "-force-d3d9" when launch the game. However, after the recent update, game only show black screen and the terminal print the following line: "GL_INVALID_FRAMEBUFFER_OPERATION in glDrawElements(incomplete framebuffer)". Has anyone experienced the same problem. I've just compiled D9VK from source and got the corresponding dll files. However, just slapping the dll files in the same location as an executable doesn't seem to actually do anything and just loads wined3d when I run a game. I.E, trying to set DXVK\_HUD=fps or even D9VK\_HUD=fps has no result. Using winecfg to force d3d9 to native just gives me "Unable to init shader system" on Source Engine games so far. What's the configuration here? There's almost no documentation anywhere Hey Gungeoneers! The AGampD update is just around the corner, and should be launching on all platforms around 10 AM EST on July 19th. Thanks as always for your patience; this update took a lot longer to finish than we expected, but we're really happy with all of the content we got into it! Below are patch notes for the launch version of AGampD and some of our initial patches. As always, if you see any issues please let us know in this thread, or reach out to us at bugreports@dodgeroll.c. Hey everyone. I've got an issue with the game. The first loading screen gets frozen very near the end, and I have to task manager my way out. amp#x200B; Things I have tried to try and tackle this problem: \-gt Compatibility \-gt Adding the bit that goes something along the lines of "-force d3d9" \-gt Verifying game files on Steam \-gt Reinstalling the game completely amp#x200B; My computer consists of: \-CPU: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-6700HQ CPU @ 2.60GHz (8 CPUs), \~2.6GHz. 
Everytime after the update I try to start the game there's a black screen and the program won't run. I've verified the game files I've reinstalled it and I've tried to set launch options to "-force -d3d9 and -d3d9) and nothing works. Does anyone have a solution for this? amp#x200B; /EDIT Updating GeForce drivers worked I got in a queue with my friend, got a game, game decided to alt-tab itself, when i alt tabbed back in, the screen was grey and had the window 95 style minimize and x buttons up on the left, i couldnt do anything except alt-f4 my game (edit: i could still hear ALL sounds in game), resulting in a 10 TP loss and a 30 MINUTE DESERTER, alt tabbing repetitively did nothing. I googled a fix after, as this was my first time experiencing this glitch/bug because im this close to hitting diamond again. Been googling and searching all kinds of forums to almost no avail. Basically, my friend just got the game and, for some reason, his game locks up but still processes his input. For instance, if he hits escape while it's frozen, the mouse appears on his screen but he's still looking at the same frame. amp#x200B; We've found, and used, two fixes that only delayed the freezing but, didn't fix it. Setting the game's launch options to -force-glcore and -force-d3d9. As the title says, I downloaded ptcgo on my ubuntu laptop, and for a few weeks it was working wonders. I also had to install Wine. Then, out of seemingly nowhere, it started black screening when I opened a pack. I can still hear and click stuff, but it won't revert the image. I have to shut down my laptop every time. amp#x200B; Does anyone know what the solution to this is? I already tried adding -force-d3d9 to the launch command, but that didn't do anything. amp#x200B; I've already responded to a few posts here and on Steam, but figured I'd make my own post about this. If you force the game to launch in Direct X 9 mode using -force-d3d9 in the command line (target field in game's shortcut properties), you'll get a big boost in performance. Made the game much more playable for me. Drawbacks: 1. My resolution is screwed up a tiny bit, but I wonder if it's because I have an old 1280x1024 monitor and the game seems to like 16:9 ratios. I've tried almost everything. Changing resolution, using -force-d3d9. I don't hear any sound. It just goes straight to black screen with the cursor. amp#x200B. When I open the game, it says "legal disclaimer - please take a moment to read" but when I click on anything the screen becomes white and a prompt says "Cities.exe has stopped working" my spec: i7 8750H gtx 1050TI 16gb ddr4 edit: FIXED! (with -force-d3d9 command). 
By switching to DX9 stops the stutter and you may even get additional frames. You can do that by putting these 2 settings -force-d3d9 -gl in the launch options on steam, i also added them as parameters in the 7 days launcher. so i don't know which one is actually correct. I also started to tweak the settings to get more stable/better fps but it seemed that dropping the settings to low/medium actually made it worse. so now i play on 1600x900 on high-highest settings on a GTX 1050Ti and getting.
